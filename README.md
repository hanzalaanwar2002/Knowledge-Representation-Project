# Academic Organization Ontology

## Overview
This project presents an **Academic Organization Ontology** designed to model the structure and relationships within a university environment.  
The ontology is developed in **OWL 2.0** and implemented using **Protégé-2000**, following standard academic ontology engineering practices.

## Objectives
- Represent academic entities such as universities, faculties, departments, programs, and people
- Model relationships between organizational units and academic roles
- Demonstrate correct usage of OWL classes, properties, and annotations
- Provide a clear and well-documented ontology suitable for academic evaluation
